Brown Furniture Company makes three kinds of office furniture: chairs, desks, and tables. Each
product requires skilled labor in the parts fabrication department, unskilled labor in the assembly
department, machining on some key pieces of equipment, and some wood as raw material. At
current prices, the unit profit contribution for each product is known, and the company can sell
everything that it manufactures. The size of the workforce has been established, so the number
of skilled and unskilled labor hours are known. The time available on the relevant equipment
has also been determined, and a known quantity of wood can be obtained each month under
a contract with a wood supplier. Managers at Brown Furniture would like to maximize their
profit contribution for the month by choosing production quantities for the chairs, desks, and
tables. The data shown below summarize the parameters of the problem.
