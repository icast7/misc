This Android Application allows you to sample your location points at time/distance intervals and send them to a webserver. You can then use a Web Application to view your location points in Google Maps. The location points are NEVER saved to your mobile device. 

An example of the Web Application can be seen at http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~jwater/

User Manuals for installing and using the Mobile and Web Applications are available in the User Manuals sectio at https://projects.cecs.pdx.edu/projects/omse-cpg/wiki
